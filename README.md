# light-tracer-inverter-monitor

I have two BH1750 light sensors on the roof, one in low res mode, one in high res mode, to track the light intensity, the hope being to switch appliances on when my charge controller has finished charging the batteries. I also monitor the epever charge controller Tracer3215BN, but believe all epever charge controllers use the same modbus registers, since I used a LS1024B for testing purposes. Lastly I have the SDM220 electricity monitor. Both these devices use modbus to communicate.

tough going not intuitive github interface!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
